/*
 * To analyze satellite images, a geospatial company studies maps of remote ocean regions.
 * Each map is represented as a grid where land and water are identified.
 *
 * Your task is to determine how many separate islands are present on a given map.
 * The map is represented as a 2D grid of characters :
 *    - '1' represents land
 *    - '0' represents water
 *
 * An island is defined as a group of connected land cells.
 * Cells are considered connected if they are adjacent horizontally or vertically(not diagonally).
 * The grid is surrounded by water.
 * 
 * Implement the function count_islands which returns the total number of islands present in the map.
